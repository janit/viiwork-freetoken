// CORS lets browser code on another origin read this node's API.
//
// This node authenticates nothing: reachability is the authorization model and
// the fleet is expected to sit on a tailnet. That is what makes an origin
// allowlist meaningful here rather than theatre — it is not protecting the API
// from a caller who can already reach it with curl, it is stopping a random
// page in a tailnet member's browser from quietly driving the fleet through
// that member's network position. Keep the list narrow.
//
// Two endpoint families need this and are easy to forget:
//
//   - The SSE streams. EventSource is CORS-bound like any other fetch but
//     sends no preflight, so it needs the header on the GET response itself.
//   - OPTIONS. The router matches only GET and POST, so a preflight would fall
//     through to 404 unless it is answered ahead of routing.
//
// Behaviour is kept identical to viiwork's so one allowlist works for a mixed
// fleet: a browser talking to both node types should not need two rules.
